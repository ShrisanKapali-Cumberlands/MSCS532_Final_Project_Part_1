## Final report

An extensive data set of size 10000000 was taken to compute or simulate the HPC data set.
Different search techniques such as linear search O(n), binary search O(logn), hash table search O(1), B-Tree search O(logn), and quicksort O(nlogn) were taken to compute the search time complexity.

Python module bisect was used for binary search trees, as in B-tree, where the data is inserted in sorted order.

An LRU cache was implemented to achieve higher performance.

Threading was also implemented to compute the search using parallelization to understand performance efficiency.

## Code Walkthough

Different search algorithms were implemented and the execution time for each search method implemented was recorded.

## Test Cases

## Stress testing

## Remaining files on GitHub

The final combined pdf document "MSCS_532_Project_Phase_4.pdf" and powerpoint presentation used in the demo "Presentation.pptx" have been uploaded. The screenshot of graphs for each search results have also been uploaded.
